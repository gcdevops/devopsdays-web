Respect and empathy are core devops values. Devopsdays is dedicated to providing an environment where everyone in the devops community can learn and share in respectful, considerate collaboration.

Every devopsdays event has a code of conduct, and we expect the organizer community before, during, and after the conferences to follow a similar code of conduct.

# CODE FOR CONDUCT

## 1. Be inclusive.

We welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, social and economic class, educational level, color, immigration status, sex, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.


## 2. Be considerate.

We all depend on each other to produce the best work we can as a team. Your decisions will affect  colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.

## 3. Be respectful.

Respect and empathy are core devops values. We won't all agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for disrespectful behaviour. We will all experience frustration from time to time, but we cannot allow that frustration become personal attacks. An environment where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive or creative one.


## 4. Choose your words carefully.

Always conduct yourself professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Harassment and exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.

## 5. Don't harass.

All DevOps members should respect their colleagues.  Devopsdays is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for every participant, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), technology choices, or any other personal characteristics. We do not tolerate harassment of anyone in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any devopsdays venue, including Slack, GitHub, and email. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the organization at the discretion of the core organizers.
Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of core organizers immediately.

## 6. Make differences into strengths.

We can find strength in diversity. Different people have different perspectives on issues, and that can be valuable for solving problems or generating new ideas. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that we all make mistakes, and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere.
Instead, focus on resolving issues and learning from mistakes.
